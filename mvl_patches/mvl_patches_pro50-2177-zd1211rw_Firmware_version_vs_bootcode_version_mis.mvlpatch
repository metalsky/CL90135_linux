Subject: [PATCH] [PATCH] zd1211rw: Firmware version vs bootcode version mismatch handling

This is needed for my G220F, otherwise it fails to initialize after the
existing firmware upload routine.

The vendor driver actually does more than what I have done here: it
downloads the firmware + boot code, modifies it, and uploads it again
(really messy). I have not copied that part over, as my device can get
on its feet without it.
